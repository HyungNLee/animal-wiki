            <p>The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), also known as
              the big-lipped bat, is a megabat widely distributed in equatorial
               Africa. This large bat is found in riverine forests, mangroves,
               swamps, and palm forests at elevations less than 1,800 metres
               (5,900 ft).

            <p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family
              Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure
              of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a
              "hammer" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are
              placed in the genus Sphyrna, while the winghead shark is placed in
               its own genus, Eusphyra.

          dwindled due to loss of habitat, any areas with an abundant supply of
           nails will soon find themselves invested by this invasive species.
